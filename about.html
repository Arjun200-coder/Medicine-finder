    <h2>Hello, I'm Arjun Dhiman ðŸ‘‹</h2>
    <br>
    <p>This is a simple Medicine Finder web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps users search generic alternatives of medicines.
        My name is Arjun Dhiman, and I am studying in Class 12. My school name is Public Inter College, Sadholi Kadeem. I live in Village Jatowala, Tehsil Behat, District Saharanpur. I study in Hindi medium. My subjects include Hindi, English, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry. There are 4 members in my family: my brother and my parents. My father works in labour. My mother is a homemaker. When my class teacher introduced me to coding, I instantly got hooked. It was fascinating to see how computer applications work as a blend of software and hardware. This experience not only sparked my curiosity but also fueled my passion to dive deeper into the world of coding.
